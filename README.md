This Project is a Quiz testing your knowledge of the Capitals of 5 different states of the United States. Try to guess them all!

The quiz has 5 multiple choice questions, along with a timer. If you guess incorrectly, the time will decrease by 15 seconds.
The faster you guess, the higher your score will be. If you are able to get all right, you may have the chance to see your
score amongst the High Scores.



The requirements for the project are as follows:
- Functional, deployed application.


GitHub repository with README describing project.


The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.


Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.


Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.


If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.


The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.


After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.
